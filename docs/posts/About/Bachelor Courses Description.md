## Introduction to Computing Systems
1. Hours Per Class: 2.5
2. Classes Per Week: 2
3. Credit: 4
4. Description:

    This is the first course in computing for students of computer engineering and electrical engineering. The objective is to provide a strong foundation that a serious student can build on in later courses across the spectrum of computer science and engineering. The idea is that a more complete understanding of the fundamentals early in your education will help you acquire a deeper understanding of more advanced topics later, whether that topic is in computer architecture, operating systems, data base, networks, algorithm design, software engineering, or whatever. I call the approach "motivated" bottom-up. That is, after providing some overview of why a new concept is important, we attempt to tie that new concept to what you already understand. Starting with the transistor as a switch, we build logic gates, then more complex logic structures, then gated latches, culminating in an implementation of memory. From there, we study the computer's instruction cycle, and then a particular computer, the LC-3 (for Little Computer 3). We got it wrong the first couple of times! The LC-3 captures the important structures of a modern computer, while keeping it simple enough to allow full understanding. The first programming assignment is in the machine language of the LC-3. From there, we move up to Assembly Language, and learn how an assembler works. The remaining programming assignments are in LC-3 Assembly Language. We cover good programming style and practice, and teach debugging from the gitgo. An LC-3 Simulator allows the student to debug his/her own programs. Input (via the keyboard) and output (via the monitor) both use physical device registers. System service routines, written in LC-3 Assembly Language are used to perform I/O functions. They are invoked by user programs by the TRAP instruction and corresponding trap vector. Subroutine calls and returns complete the LC-3 instruction set.
