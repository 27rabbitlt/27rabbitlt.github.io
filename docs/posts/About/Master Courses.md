Here are the courses I've taken in ETH Zurich:

## Algebraic Method in Combinatorics

Focusing on algebraic way to interpret and solve combinatoric problems. There are some problems and topics particularly interesting, e.g.: odd-town even-town problem, finite field Kakeya set problem, convex geometry, spectral graph theory, and Chavelly Warning theorem, Combinatorial Nullstellenz theorem, and their applications.

这门课内容对我来说比较难，本身组合就很费脑子，再加上是前期线性代数基本都忘掉了，过得比较痛苦。
