## Basic Definitions

Some important groups:

+ Symmetric group $S_n$: group of permutations on $n$ symbols
+ Alternating group $A_n$: group of even permutations on $n$ symbols
+ Dihedral group $D_n$: group of $n$-dim polygon rotations and reflections, containing $2n$ elements.
+ Quaternion group $Q_8$: $\langle \bar{e}, i, j, k | \bar{e}^2 = e, i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = \bar{e} \rangle$
